# angular-drills

## Set 1

``1``
Create a basic angular app where you type in a text box and it shows up as text somewhere else on the screen.

``2``
Create an app where there is an array of data in the service that is shown on the screen as a list

``3``
Create an app where there is a list of data on the screen (stored in a service) where you can type to filter what's shown in the list

``4``
Create an app hitting an api (swapi.co, birdapi.com, pokeapi, [smurfs](http://smurfs.devmounta.in/smurfs/), marvel api, etc)

``5``
Make a larger app if you have time.

## Set 2

``6``
Create an app that has three routes (using ui-router):
* home `/`
* sign up `/signup`
* details `/details`

Create templates for each and a simple menu that allows you to navigate between all three routes.

Use any of the APIs listed in app #4 above.  Get data in the details screen. Show that data on the details state/view. Be sure the call to retrieve the data resides in a service.

``7``
Create a simple element directive that loads in a header from a template using templateUrl

``8``
Create a "login" element directive that includes two text inputs, "username" and "password", and a button ("login"). When the login button is clicked, show an alert.

``9``
Create an attribute directive that will be applied to an input type=text. When clicked, the directive should highlight/select all the text in the input.

``10``
Create an element directive that is passed an image string via an attribute (isolated scope) and renders the img via an HTML img tag.

Example markup
```
<my-directive img-src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/ff/SuccessKid.jpg"></my-directive>
```

To go further, have the above directive make the image's opacity fade by 50% when hovered over. (You'll need to use Angular's built-in jQuery implementation and the linker function).
