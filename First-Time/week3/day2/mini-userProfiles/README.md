# User Profiles
### Understanding Services

## Objective
### To better understand the relationship between Angular controllers and services.

## Step 1 - Review setup
You have some starting files to work with.  Spend a couple minutes looking through them and understanding what's going on.
You have an app, a controller, an index file, and a stylesheet.

## Step 2 - Our service
- Create an angular service file and an angular service inside it.  You can call in `mainService`.
- Make sure the app names match or it won't work.
- Test it by making sure there are no errors in your console.
- If Angular is broken you probably didn't add it to the index.html file.
- We will also want to load some data into our service. Copy the following data into the service:
``` json
[{
    "id": 0,
    "first_name": "george",
    "last_name": "bluth",
    "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/calebogden/128.jpg"
},
{
    "id": 1,
    "first_name": "lucille",
    "last_name": "bluth",
    "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/josephstein/128.jpg"
},
{
    "id": 2,
    "first_name": "oscar",
    "last_name": "bluth",
    "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/olegpogodaev/128.jpg"
}]
```

So now our service should look like this:

``` javascript
angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function() {
  var data = 
  [
    {
        "id": 0,
        "first_name": "george",
        "last_name": "bluth",
        "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/calebogden/128.jpg"
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "lucille",
        "last_name": "bluth",
        "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/josephstein/128.jpg"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "first_name": "oscar",
        "last_name": "bluth",
        "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/olegpogodaev/128.jpg"
    }
  ]
});
```

## Step 3 - Our Service
Our Service will do most of the app's heavy lifting. We want to keep our controllers as slim as possible. To do that we will need to create a function that delivers our data to our controller.
- Write a function in your service called "getUsers" that will `return` all of our user data to the controller.
  - Remember: functions made in a service can be tied to the service object via the "this" keyword. 

## Step 4 - Our Controller
The next thing we need to do is to create a function in our controller that retrieves the data from the service and prepares it to be sent to the view.

- In the controller.js file, create a function on the $scope object named "getUsers".
- Then, inject the mainService in the controller.
- Now, within the new getUsers function, we can access the mainService's getUsers function.
  - Let's set a variable called $scope.users equal to the result of the mainService's function.
  - Also, we should invoke our $scope.getUsers function after we have declared it or it won't run.

Now we have an object named "$scope.users" which represents our data. Because it is on the $scope object we can access it in our view by placing this within the body of our index.html, using `{{}}` binding.


# Step 5 - The View
Now we have our data in our view, but it's a little ugly. Let's do some simple configuration to make it a bit more user-friendly. Typically when you have an array of data, it's a good idea to use `ng-repeat` to organize it.

Now we should have some awesome user profiles! 

# Step 6 - Returning to the service
We want to be able to 'favorite' each user and have that saved and reflected.

* In the service, make a new function called `toggleFavorite`. It takes in an index number and uses it to modify the data at that index to change an 'isFavorite' property back and forth between true and false.
* In the controller, add that function to your controller's $scope (Don't invoke it, just assign it).
* In the html, Add a button inside the `ng-repeat` to each user that invokes the toggleFunction and passes in the user id.
`ng-click="toggleFavorite(user.id)`
Note: This only works because the user.id's match their index in the array of profiles.

* Last, we're going to use `ng-class` to style the html conditionally.  The format looks like this `ng-class="{class-name: javascriptExpression }`
Our code is going to look like this : `ng-class="{favorite: user.isFavorite}"`.  We're telling angular that when user.isFavorite is true to apply the .favorite class.  And when it's false to remove it.

# Final Code

```javascript
//controller
angular.module('userProfiles').controller('MainController', function($scope, mainService){
    
    $scope.getUsers = function(){
        $scope.users = mainService.getUsers();
    }
    
    $scope.getUsers();
    
    $scope.toggleFavorite = mainService.toggleFavorite;
})
```

```javascript
//service

angular.module('userProfiles').service('mainService', function(){
    var data =  [{
    "id": 0,
    "first_name": "george",
    "last_name": "bluth",
    "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/calebogden/128.jpg",
    "isFavorite": true
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "lucille",
        "last_name": "bluth",
        "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/josephstein/128.jpg"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "first_name": "oscar",
        "last_name": "bluth",
        "avatar": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/uifaces/faces/twitter/olegpogodaev/128.jpg"
    }];

    this.getUsers = function(){
        return data;   
    }
    
    this.toggleFavorite = function(userIndex){
        data[userIndex].isFavorite = !data[userIndex].isFavorite;
    }
})
```
