A mini-project to practice Passport/Node.js

##Objectives
Create a simple app that shows Auth0 Profile information.

You can use the [passport-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/passport-auth0) GitHub repo for a guide.

##Step 1: Set up passport, passport-auth0, express
Set up a server.js file and include these npm dependencies:
* express
* express-session
* passport
* passport-auth0

Go over to the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/) and Add a New App (aka Client). Call it whatever you'd like.

Now let's put in the code necessary to get our authentication working:
* Create your express app, have it listen to a port that works for you
* Require passport and the passport Auth0Strategy
* Include the session middleware

`app.use(session({secret: 'some-random-string'}))`

* Include the passport.initialize middleware

`app.use(passport.initialize())`

* Include the passport.session middleware

`app.use(passport.session())`

* Define the FacebookStrategy

```javascript
passport.use(new Auth0Strategy({
  domain: '<your_auth0_domain>',
  clientID: '<your_client_id>',
  clientSecret: '<your_client_secret>',
  callbackURL: 'http://localhost:3000/auth/callback'
}, function(accessToken, refreshToken, extraParams, profile, done) {
  return done(null, profile);
}));
```

##Step 2: Define your auth endpoints
Create two routes that will handle your Auth0 auth.

####GET /auth
This route simply implements the passport.authenticate method, passing 'auth0' as the parameter.

####GET /auth/callback
This route needs to pass the passport.authenticate method again, except we also need to pass in an object that passes the successRedirect and failureRedirect paths.

##Step 3: Create the deserialize/serializer methods on passport.
Since you won't be doing anything further than just passing objects to/from passport and the session, we just need bare bones methods here:

```
passport.serializeUser(function(user, done) {
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function(obj, done) {
  done(null, obj);
});
```

###Step 4: Create viewer endpoint
Now we're going to create an endpoint that returns the current logged in user's auth profile data.

####GET /me
Create this route in your server.js that returns the user's auth profile data. The data is stored in `req.user` if you've set everything up correctly. Return a JSON representation of this data at the `/me` endpoint.

Use the browser to verify that you can in fact get the JSON data from the `/me` endpoint.
