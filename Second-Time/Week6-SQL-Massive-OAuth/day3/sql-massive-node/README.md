# sql-massive-node

Today we're going to make our first full CRUD back-end.

I'll be referring to this mini project through these instructions : https://github.com/DevMountain/mini-sql-node-massive

## Setup your server

Get your basic server working.  Follow the steps from the mini-project to setup a server :

* Require and setup express and get it listening on a port
* Require MassiveJS and Connect to a database (make a new one, or use one you've already made).
* Add db to our express app, put the massive instance on there and export our app (see the mini-project)

## Understand your data

We are going to be working with a single table, products.  It's schema will look something like this:

* ID : Primary key number
* Name : string
* Description: string
* Price: number
* Imageurl : string

## Create your .sql files

* Create a folder called db and place 5 files in there:
  * create_product
  * read_products
  * read_product
  * update_product
  * delete_product
  
* Create a working SQL query for each one.  You can use pgAdmin to test your queries against the database.

__create_product__

This query will need to take the 4 parameters defined in the schema and insert a record into the database.

__read_products__

This query will get all products in the table and return only the name, price, and image url

__read_product__

This query will take in an id and return all data for that product

__update_product__

This query will take in an id and a new description.  Find the product with the id and update it's description with the new description.

__delete_product__

This query will take in an id.  Find and delete the product with the id.


## Run your queries in your controller

* Create a productsCtrl.js
    * Export an object with 5 functions
        * Create, GetOne, GetAll, Update, Delete
    * At the top of the controller (outside the object), get the db object off of our express app (see mini-project)
    * Inside of Create use the create_product query
    * Inside of GetAll use the read_products query
    * Inside of GetOne, use the read_product query
    * Inside of Update, use the update_product query
    * Inside of Delete, use the delete_product query
    

## Create endpoints

* Create some endpoints on express.  Create one for each query type.

__Sample Urls__

`GET  /api/products`
`GET  /api/product/:productId`
`PUT  /api/product/:productId?desc=....`
`POST /api/product`
`DELETE /api/product/:productId`

## Wire your endpoints up to your controller

* Get any information you need off of the query parameters, query, or body and pass them into your controller
* You will need to add parameters in your controller functions to receive these values.

## Test

* You should have a working crud app.  Use postman to insert a few records, modify them, query them, and delete them to make sure it's all working.

## Black Diamond

* Create an angular front end to interact with your app.
* Use express static to serve up your angular files from a public folder
* Create a single view that can insert, read, update, and delete products.
* Create a 2nd page that just reads the products and displays them in a more pretty way (like Jane.com or amazon).
