# mini-sql-node-massive

## Setup

Run `npm install` to install the pre-requisites

Look over the index.js file to get familiar with your starting point.

## Get your database started

Make sure postgres is running on your computer.

## Install MassiveJS

Run `npm install --save massive`

Require massive at the top of your index file.

`var massive = require('massive');`

## Setup our table

Make a new database in postgres called sandbox

Add a new table to that database ( [pgAdmin tutorial on how to do both of these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvDVBjNDys) ) :

```
CREATE TABLE airplanes (
  planeid SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, -- The primary key
  planetype varchar(40) NOT NULL, -- The IP of the host
  passengercount integer NOT NULL -- The name of the host
);
```


## Connect with Massive to our database

We need to get a copy of massive ot use.  We need : `connectionString > connection > db`

Add a connection string under your call to require massive.  Change the part that says jeremyrobertson to have your user name.  (If you included password it will look like `username:password@localhost/sandbox`

__connectionString__
```
var massive = require('massive');
var connectionString = "postgres://jeremyrobertson@localhost/sandbox";
```

Use our connection string to get a copy/instance of massive to use.  Then add it to our app as a variable called db.

__connection__
```
var massiveInstance = massive.connectSync({connectionString : connectionString})

app.set('db', massiveInstance);
```

Next we can get our db back out of the app

__db__
```
var db = app.get('db');
```


## Add a new plane to the database

Now that we have our db we can use it to add a new plane:

```
db.new_plane(function(err, planes){
    console.log(err, "plane added")
});
```

This works by looking in the `/db` folder in our app fore a file called `new_plane.sql`

We've added a plane, comment those 3 lines of code out so we don't add duplicates.


## Get all planes

Do the same thing to get all planes using the get_planes file

```
db.get_planes(function(err, planes){
    console.log(err, planes)
})
```

## Queries in different files

To use our db in different files we need to do 2 things:

* export the app made by express
* import it and use it in our other file
* call our controller

__export our app__
```
//Replace
var app = express();

//With
var app = module.exports = express();
```

This makes it so index.js exports our app.


__ import it and use it in another file__

Create a controller.js and put this code inside.

```
var app = require('./index');

module.exports = {
    getPlanes: function(){
        var db = app.get('db');

        db.get_planes(function(err, planes){
            console.log(err, planes);
        })
    }
}
```

__call our controller__

Comment out call calls to db in your index.js and replace them with a call to the controller and the get planes function.

```
var controller = require('./controller.js');

controller.getPlanes();
```

## Parameterize our Query

In get_planes.sql uncomment out `where passengercount > $1` by removing the two `--` in front of it.

The $1 acts as a place holder for the 'first' parameter passed in.

To pass that in change the query in controller.js to take parameters before the function.

```
db.get_planes([25], function(err, planes){
    console.log(err, planes);
})
```        

We are now getting all planes with a passenger count greater than 25.
