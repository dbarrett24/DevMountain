# simple-sql-queries

For today we will be practicing inserting and querying data using SQL.

Here is a website that will let us write queries to interact with some data.  [http://jxs.me/chinook-web/](http://jxs.me/chinook-web/)

On the left are the Tables with their fields.  The right is where we will be writing our queries.  The bottom is where we will see our results.  

Any new tables or records that we add into the database will be removed after you refresh the page.  So if you're wondering where you data went, that may be why.

Use [www.sqlteaching.com](http://www.sqlteaching.com/) or [sqlbolt.com](http://sqlbolt.com/) as resources for the missing keywords you'll need.

## PERSON
1. Create a table called Person that records a person's Name, Age, Height, City, FavoriteColor, and Id.  Id should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key.  
2. Add 5 different people into the Person database.  Remember to not include the Id because it should auto-increment.
3. List the people in the Person table by Height from tallest to shortest (descending)

(For this database to create an auto incrementing field set it's type to INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT)

  * List the people in the Person table by Height from shortest to tallest (ascending)
  * List all the people in the Person table by oldest first

## ORDER 
4. Create a table called Orders that records the productName, productPrice, Quantity, and personId

6. Select all the records from the Order table

  * Calculate the total number of products Ordered
