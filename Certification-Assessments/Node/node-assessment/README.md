# Node Assessment

## setup
1. Run `npm install` to install testing dependencies.
2. Create a file called `server.js`. All your server code and endpoints should be in this file.
3. Create a file called `userCtrl.js`. You will write your endpoints and export each one from this file.
** NOTE: `module.exports` your `app` at the end of `server.js`, otherwise the tests won't work **

## Users Module
You will be using the users module in your test. It is located in the file `users.js`

The users module is intended to be your way of controlling the data.
Do not make any changes to this file. Make sure you only use
`users.js` to make all your changes to the data.

A user has the following keys and values:

```
id: number
first_name: string
last_name: string
email: string
gender: string,
language: string,
age: number,
city: string,
state: string,
type: string,
favorites: array of strings
```

The users module has the following methods:

#### add
* Takes in a properly formatted user object.
* This will throw an exception if the user is improperly formatted!
* Will automatically add an id and return the new user object, with the id.
So don't put an id on a new user!

#### findOne
* Takes in a key and a value
* Returns the first user where the key matches the value
* Example:
```javascript
users.findOne('id', 1) // User object with an id of 1;
```

#### find
* Takes in a key and a value
* Like findOne but it will return all matching users as an array
* If it only finds one user it will still return an array.

#### remove
* Takes in a key and a value
* Like find but will remove all matching users.

#### update
* Takes in a key, a value, and an object with some keys and values.
* The keys and values in the object passed to update will be merged into the first user found matching key and value.
* Example:
```javascript
  users.update('id', 1, {first_name: 'Brett', last_name: 'Internet'});
```
After this function runs, the user with an id of 1 will have a **first_name** of **Brett** and a **last_name** of **Internet**

## User Controller

`userCtrl.js`.

Be sure to follow the instructions for each problem closely.
**You should not be using req or res inside `userCtrl.js`.**

Example:
```javascript
module.exports ={
  methodName: function(/*Parameters here if input is needed*/) {
    // Find/Add/Update/Delete something
    return somethingArray; // Or null if it is required.
  }
}
```

1. Get All Users.
  -Write a function called readAll that will return all users from the users module.
2. Get User By Id.
  -Write a function called findUserById that will take in a userId, use that to find the user with that id and return that user's information. If there is no user with that ID, return null.
3. Get All Admin Users.
  -Write a function called getAdmins which will return an array of all users with a type of 'admin'. Return null if none are found.
4. Get All Non Admin Users (regular users)
  -Write a function called getNonAdmins which will return an array of all users who have a type of 'user'. Return null if none are found.
5. Get All users with a specified favorite.
  -The function getUsersByFavorite will take in a favorite as a string, and use it to return all users with that favorite in their favorites array. If none are found, return null.
6. Get all users with age under given age.
  -Write a function, getUsersByAgeLimit, that will take in an age and return all users under the age provided. If none are found, it will return null.
7. Get User By last_name.
  -Write a function called findUserByQuery. This function will take in two parameters: a query term and the value. If the query term is 'last_name', the function will use the value parameter to return the user (or users) with that last_name. Make sure that the search is case-insensitive. If the user is not found, return null.
8. Get User By Email.
  -Adjust findUserByQuery to search for a user by email, if the query term equals 'email'. Again, it will search using the value parameter, return that found user, or if not found, return null.
9. Get User By State.
  -Adjust findUserByQuery once more to also search for user by state if the query term equals 'state'.  It will search using the value parameter, and return the user (or users) from that state.  If no users are found it should return null.
10. Add new user.
  -Write a function, createUser, that takes a user object as a parameter to the users module. Create a user using this object. Remember, the users module will generate an id itself, so you don't have to. If the user is not in the correct format, the users module will give you an error. If there is an error from the users module, return null. Otherwise, return the new user (with automatically generated id).
11. Update user by ID.
  -Write a function called updateUser which will take in a userId and an object. The object will contain the properties that need to be changed, along with their new values. Find a user by the id, then update it, changing only those properties sent in the object. Return the updated user.
12. Delete a user by ID.
  -Your function, removeUser, should take in a userId, find a user by that id, then use the user module's remove functionality to delete the user. Return the deleted item.

## Endpoints
`server.js`

Once you are finished with your controller, write endpoints that will accept the test's requests.
You are expected to use the method above associated with each endpoint:

Example:
```javascript
app.get('url', function(req, res) {
  var response = userCtrl.methodName(/*arguments if needed. eg: req.params.id*/);

  res.status(/*status needed to make test work*/).send(response);
});
```

1. `'GET' /api/users`
Respond with an array of all users, with status 200.

This endpoint can be called with one of these queries, which you should be prepared to address:
* favorites : Return all users who have this favorite in their list of favorites.
* age : Return all users who have an age less than this age.
* lastname : Return all users whose last name matches.
* email : Return one user whose email matches.

2. `'GET' /api/users` + userId
The test will a GET request with the userId as a parameter to this endpoint. Remember, request params will come as strings. If the user is found, respond with status 200 and send that user information. If no user was found, respond with a status 404.

3. `'GET' /api/admins`
Respond with status 200, and an array of all admins.

4. `'GET' /api/nonadmins`
Respond with status 200, and an array of all non-admin users.

5. `'PUT' /api/users/` + userId
The test will PUT with an object in the body. You should update the user matching userId
with this object.

6. `'POST' /api/users`
The test will POST with a valid user object in the body. You should add this user and return status 200.

7. `'DELETE' /api/users/` + userId
The test will DELETE with a param of a userId. You should remove the user with matching userId,
returning status 200 and the deleted user.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run automatically. After setup, run `npm test` to check tests.

Before running the tests, comment out your app.listen() function or you will get an error.

If you want, you can have tests run in watch mode, where tests will run again after files change.
Run `npm test -- --watch` for watch mode.

## About the testing software

The testing software runs automatically. It will test your code endpoint by endpoint
and piece by piece. It is important that you name your module methods and files exactly according to the instructions.

A lot of times a failing test indicates something wrong with your code. Students are naturally suspicious of the testing software.
If you think there is something wrong with the testing software, ask a mentor to look at your answer.
A mentor can tell you whether the testing software is wrong or whether you are, but cannot tell you the answer.

If you find a test that is not working correctly, or that you think is testing incorrectly, please create an issue on Github.
